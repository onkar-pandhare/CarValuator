# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the price of used cars based on features like brand, year, fuel type, transmission, and more. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and a regression model to estimate prices.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ’» How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
2. Open `PRJ Car Price Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook step by step to see the results and predictions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output
- Trained model: Linear Regression
- Evaluation metric: RÂ² Score = 0.87 (example)
- Predicts prices based on user input features
